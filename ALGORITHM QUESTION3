Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
Start
Ask the user to enter num1
Ask the user to enter num2 
Ask the user to enter operator (+,-,/,%,*)
Declare result =0
If operator is + then
Print result = num1+num2
Else if operator is â€“ then 
Print result = num1-num2
Else if operator is / then
Print result = num1/num2
Else if operator is % then 
Print result = num1%num2
Else if operator is * then 
Print result = num1*num2
Else 
Print invalid operator
End
