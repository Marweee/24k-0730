1.	Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
Start
Ask the user to input two integers 
make sure N is not equal to zero if N=0 then print error
otherwise find the remainder when n is divided by N (n % N) 
if n % N =0 then print N is a divisor of n 
otherwise print N is not a divisor of n 
If Nmod2 =0 print N is even otherwise N is odd
End
